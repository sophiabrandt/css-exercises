# css-exercises

**css-exercises** is a place to store my CSS exercises.

I use the techniques from **[Every Layout][every]** and **[CUBE CSS][cube]**.

## Installation

You'll need Node.js for [live serving the files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sophiabrandt/css-exercises.git && cd css-exercises
```

## Usage

Choose a folder. Inside that folder, run:

```bash
npx live-server
```

Or open the HTML file manually.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
